The thing that I notice first on any OS is the user interface, so that's what I'll focus on. When your computer 
starts up, you want the interface to be clear and understandable, and not hard to work with. I imagine a lot of 
work went into, for example, how fast the mouse should move across the screen, so as not to be annoyingly slow or 
too fast to hit targets. The interface has to tell you if there are hardware problems, net connection problems,
or anything you have to fix before you can get your stuff done. (Sometimes it seems Windows could do a better job
of specifying what the problem is and how to fix it.)
